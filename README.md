MLVD is a platform to meet the needs of users to detect whether a certain contract contains some kind of vulnerability. 
The system is developed based on Python language and Django framework, providing users with a network platform to detect whether there are vulnerabilities in smart contracts on Ether. 
The platform includes a user management module, a data management module, and a vulnerability detection module, which can detect vulnerabilities in access control, integer overflow, denial of service, transaction order dependency, re-entry, timestamp dependency, and unchecked call return values.
